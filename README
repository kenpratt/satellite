= Satellite

Satellite is a distributed wiki client. One or more Satellite clients can
synchronize with the same headless Satellite repository. The client(s) store
content locally and mirror with the server when a network connection is
available. So you can edit your Satellite wiki when offline, and your changes
will be reflected in other Satellite clients when you re-connect to the
internet.

Satellite uses "Git":http://git.or.cz/ as its storage engine, and the master
Satellite repository is nothing more then a regular Git repository. Satellite
clients are written in "Ruby":http://www.ruby-lang.org/ and utilize the
"Mongrel":http://mongrel.rubyforge.org/ web server, so each machine running
a Satellite client requires Ruby and Mongrel to be installed, as well as a
password-less method of committing to the master repository.
