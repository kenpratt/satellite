= Satellite

== Tasks

=== Bugs

* none? (ha!)

=== Now (pre-1.0) (priority in brackets)

* (5) make a logo! (and favicon to match)
* (5) better installation instructions
* (2) set up deployment (rake/capistrano/vlad)
* (1) satellite-wiki.com
* (1) separate page sync and upload sync, since the latter is so much slower and less likely to cause merge issues?
* (1) tests: use fixtures for data loading?

=== Soon (maybe 1.0, maybe later)

* fix incoming links during page rename operations
* remove upload/image box from current page when you delete it
* page history view
* revert page to some previous version
* extend search to search upload names (and upload content?)
* speed up search by limiting to pages dir only? (profile first)
* replace custom app reloader with Rack::Reloader

=== Later?

* list page: highlight orphaned (no incoming links) items with red backgrounds (got it working already, but is suuuper slow)
* console that loads app + irb
* prettier web interface for manual conflict resolution
* user system/password protection? (but need db, cookies, etc, maybe just use httpauth or Rack::Auth)
* multiple remote repository support (instead of master/slave)
* tagging
* del.icio.us integration
* show sync progress?
* more profiling
* extend URLMap to provide regex mapping? (and get rid of the ugly uploads/ hack?) -- tried this, didn't work too well
