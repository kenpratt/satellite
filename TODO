= Satellite

== Tasks

=== Now (pre-1.0) (priority in brackets)

* (5) make a logo! (and favicon to match)
* (5) hotkey reference (legend)
* (5) wiki markup reference on new/edit pages
* (5) better installation instructions
* (4) list page: icons to rename, delete pages/uploads
* (4) allow deletion of uploads
* (3) fork ruby/git instead of monkeypatching it
* (3) profiling/performance testing (particularly, would caching the Git obj speed up "DB" calls?)
* (2) set up deployment (rake/capistrano/vlad)
* (2) allow renaming of uploads
* (2) list page: highlight orphaned (no incoming links) items with red backgrounds
* (2) on app startup, don't start server until sync is complete (also: show sync progress?)
* (1) append last-mod date to CSS/Javascript (create method to calc last mod time, return uri)
* (1) polish up rspec testing framework
* (1) satellite-wiki.com
* (1) log to file instead of stdout

=== Soon (maybe 1.0, maybe later)

* fix incoming links during page rename operations
* page history view
* revert page to some previous version

=== Later?

* console that loads app + irb
* prettier web interface for manual conflict resolution
* user system/password protection? (but need db, cookies, etc, maybe just use httpauth)
* multiple remote repository support (instead of master/slave)
* tagging
* del.icio.us integration
* switch from direct mongrel inheritance to rack adapter
* take another look at app auto-reloading
