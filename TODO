= Satellite

== Tasks

=== Now (pre-1.0) (priority in brackets)

* (5) make a logo! (and favicon to match)
* (5) better installation instructions
* (3) fork ruby/git instead of monkeypatching it
* (3) profiling/performance testing (particularly, would caching the Git obj speed up "DB" calls?)
* (2) set up deployment (rake/capistrano/vlad)
* (1) polish up rspec testing framework
* (1) satellite-wiki.com
* (1) log to file instead of stdout

=== Soon (maybe 1.0, maybe later)

* fix incoming links during page rename operations
* page history view
* revert page to some previous version
* extend search to search upload names (and upload content?)

=== Later?

* list page: highlight orphaned (no incoming links) items with red backgrounds (got it working already, but is suuuper slow)
* console that loads app + irb
* prettier web interface for manual conflict resolution
* user system/password protection? (but need db, cookies, etc, maybe just use httpauth)
* multiple remote repository support (instead of master/slave)
* tagging
* del.icio.us integration
* switch from direct mongrel inheritance to rack adapter
* take another look at app auto-reloading
