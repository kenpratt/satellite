== Tasks

=== Bugs

* list page: sort puts lowercase items at the end -- change to mixed case alphabetical
* app won't start up while offline (due to the "feature" i added of waiting for sync before server starts)

=== Now (pre-1.0) (priority in brackets)

* (5) make a logo! (and favicon to match)
* (5) better installation instructions
* (4) create "repack_locally" script to pull, repack, and rsync pack files to server
* (3) fork ruby/git instead of monkeypatching it
* (3) profiling/performance testing (particularly, would caching the Git obj speed up "DB" calls?)
* (2) set up deployment (rake/capistrano/vlad)
* (1) polish up rspec testing framework
* (1) satellite-wiki.com
* (1) log to file instead of stdout
* (1) prettier 404 page (just render 404 error into template)
* (1) extend URLMap to provide regex mapping? (and gid rid of the ugly uploads/ hack?)
* (1) refactor config to be a member variable instead of a constant (like logger)
* (1) speed up search by limiting to pages/ dir only?

=== Soon (maybe 1.0, maybe later)

* fix incoming links during page rename operations
* page history view
* revert page to some previous version
* extend search to search upload names (and upload content?)
* replace custom app reloader with Rack::Reloader

=== Later?

* list page: highlight orphaned (no incoming links) items with red backgrounds (got it working already, but is suuuper slow)
* console that loads app + irb
* prettier web interface for manual conflict resolution
* user system/password protection? (but need db, cookies, etc, maybe just use httpauth or Rack::Auth)
* multiple remote repository support (instead of master/slave)
* tagging
* del.icio.us integration
* switch from direct mongrel inheritance to rack adapter
* take another look at app auto-reloading
* show sync progress?
